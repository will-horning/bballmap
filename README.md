This app is designed to graph a rough probability distribution of a basketball player's local shooting percentage (i.e. their shooting percentage from a 1-foot x 1-foot location on the court). The statisical model is extremely basic but you can see some patterns in certain players' shooting behaviour.  All the data is stored in shots.db, it was scraped from cbssports.com and contains every shot taken in an NBA game from 2011 - 2013. 

There is a very basic web interface setup from main.py but if you would like to create plots from the command line, see heatmap.py.  An older version is also available at http://willhorning.pythonanywhere.com.
